                <p>The primary driver of the state’s population loss over the past couple years has been the result of
                    California residents moving to other states. It is a remarkable turnaround for California—long the
                    epicenter of population growth in the United States. Even so, it is a continuation of a decades-long
                    slow down.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <strong> Since 2010, books 7.5 million people moved from California to other states, while only 5.8
                        million people moved to California from other parts of the country. According to Department of
                        Finance estimates, the state has lost residents to other states every year since 2001.
                        But its more visibile after COVID-19.

                    Californians with the highest incomes contribute the most to the state's personal income tax. From
                    the 2019 tax year, the top 1% of income earners paid almost 45 percent of all personal income taxes.
                    Since 2004, % is always 40% and high.
                    <br> <strong>But, recently the flow of middle and low-class citizens leaving the state has
                        intensified during the last five years, and net growth among those with higher incomes have
