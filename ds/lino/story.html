  <h1>Death To Public Schools</h1>
  <h3>by Robert Lino</h3>
  <p>Funding for K-12 schools has been in decline for a while and that is even worsen by states cutting taxes-their main source of funding. Even though data from the U.S. Census Bureau shows an increase in spending in 2015, 29 states were still struggling to bring up spending per student to pre-recession funding of 2008.This under-funding amounts to nearly $150 billion  annually according to the Century Foundation which robs 30 million children of resources.

      <h2>Looking For a Scapegoat</h2>
      <p>Public education in the U.S. is a topic that makes people run to their corners. Lines are always drawn when students’ performance in the classroom,their test scores and graduation rates are below expectations. At this point, people begin to look for a scapegoat; luck of money or bad teachers? And once you throw politics into the mix, then it becomes a blue against red battle.
      </p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
      <p>From 1990 to 2019, states like New York, New Jersey and the District of Columbia have increased their spending. Whenever the increase in spending does not yield the results wanted,the blame goes to teachers and shutting down underperforming schools becomes the solution. As such in New York City, closing schools has become a way of clearing out who are not producing results; low standardized test scores.
      </p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
      <p>Most states share the same reasons that the city of New York and the city of Chicago listed for closing down schools. These reasons are low enrollment, poor performance, clear out underperforming teachers and replacing larger schools with small charter schools.</p>

      <h2>Looking the other way</h2>
      <p>The decline of public investment in K-12 Since 2008, the number of public K-12 teachers and other school workers has fallen by 135,000 and the number of students has risen by 1,419,000. This decline of public investment in K-12 is very concerning to the country’s future for the health of the nation's economy depends on the creativity and intellectual capacity of the people.</p>
      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
       <p> It is an oxymoron that many states and school districts said that their priority is preparing children for a better future, improving teachers’ quality while funding for schools is always on the cutting board.
        As long as this trend of cutting funds continues, children will continue to be the victims of this fight.</p>

      <h2>Punching Below the Line</h2>
     <p>According to Census data available on state local funding, twenty-nine states fall below the national average funding per student. Adding to the damage , local government funding per student fell in nineteen states. Even though some states increased their local funding, those increases did not make up for cuts in state funding.
    </p>
    <p>Based on the Census data, most of the states that are underfunding their schools, scored below 50 on the scoreboard out of 100 points. A few states like Georgia,Indiana,Louisiana,Nevada, South Dakota, Utah and Virginia that are underfunding their schools scored between 50 and 61 points. Among these states, Virginia is an outlier for it underfunded its schools and scored 61.79 points and also ranked number 4 in the nation.

    <p>This country is facing a new era in public education and the results of the changes have a lot of consequences. It does not matter whether one is for or against extra funding, school closures, standardized testing and teachers,the point that is missing from the debate is the economic or social status of the affected students. Nobody brings into the debate the rust belt areas that depended on steel and the Appalachian region that depended on coal.
