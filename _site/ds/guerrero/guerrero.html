    <h2>We all curse</h2>

    <!-- Intro Text -->
    <p class="bodyText">We all curse. Whether we‚Äôre venting, complaining or just saying something‚Äôs <em>cool as shit</em>, it‚Äôs human nature to curse. 
        Some say that cursing is <a href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/swearing-and-intelligence/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a sign of intelligence</a>,
        that it helps us <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-do-we-swear/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">manage pain</a> and helps us
        <a href="https://www.babbel.com/en/magazine/why-do-we-swear" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">deal with tough situations</a>. I personally just think
        it feels real fucking goooood to swear. It lets us get out emotion, helps us add a human touch to our communication, and maybe even helps us belong and fit in with
        those around us.</p>

    <!-- Cursing in Spanish -->
    <p class="bodyText">Cursing in Spanish is all books creativity. The more words you smush together and the weirder your insults...the better. Take, for example, 
        the Nicaraguan word <em>hijuelagrancienmilputa</em>. I just said ‚Äúson of a one hundred thousand big whores.‚Äù In one word.</p>
    <p class="bodyText">Every country has their unique and hilarious brand of cursing. And while it can lead to some entertaining phrases, it also means that,
        like Joanna, it's easy to accidentally insult your nice elderly neighbors.</p>

            <h5>Just add ‚Äòchingar‚Äô between every other word</h5>
            
            <p>In Mexico alone, the word chingar has at least 10 different meanings. Exhausted, busy, and stressed (like a grad student during finals week)?
                Well tell your friends <em> que estas en chinga</em>. That house party you were just invited to is too far? <em> ¬°Eso esta a la chingada!
                    </em>   Screw you? <em> ¬°Pues, Chinga tu Madre! </em> Or is something just super dope? <em> Pero que chingon, g√ºey! </em> 
                    This word‚Äôs got it all.</p>

                <p>Then, we have <em>cabr√≥n</em>, which technically means "male billy goat" but can be used the same way as "dude," to admire someone
                    for being really skilled at something‚Ä¶ or to call someone an idiot.</p>

            <p>And we can‚Äôt forget the famous Mexican <em>g√ºey </em>. A colloquialism that pretty much identifies a Spanish speaker as a true Mexican.
                Its meaning ranges from a casual ‚Äúhey, dude!‚Äù to ‚Äúdon‚Äôt be an idiot.‚Äù</p>

            <p>Ohh, the word <em>verga</em>! This one deserves an award. With 11 different meanings, this one beats out a lot of other curses. Spanish for ‚Äúdick,‚Äù

                <p>Wanna talk books drinking? <em>¬°Pongamonos a verga!</em> Mad at someone? Tell them you're going to <em>darle verga</em>. Someone screwed you over? 
                <em>¬°Es que, me metieron la verga!</em> Wanna compliment or admire something? Look at it and say <em> ¬°Que verga!</em></p>

            <p>An honorable mention also goes to the word <em>cerote</em>. This word literally means "turd," and has at least 4 different meanings. 
            Similarly to <em>verga</em>, can be used in a lot of situations: when you‚Äôre mad, to talk books actual crap, or to say hi to a friend.</p>

            <h5>Where "go to the frilly sleeve" is somehow‚Ä¶ an insult? ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è </h5>
            <p>Oh, Cubans! As a people, Cubans are known for being friendly, flirty, and charming. Which is why their insults are uhm‚Ä¶ on the more creative side. 
                A favorite Cuban curse word is <em>pu√±eta</em>, which translates to the word "sleeve," specifically the frilly sleeve you'd find on a pirate shirt.</p>

            <p><iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/B5fTjyTKjb5te" width="480" height="330" frameBorder="0" class="giphy-embed" allowFullScreen></iframe></p>

            <p>To curse in a moment of frustration, just say <em>¬°Pu√±eta!</em> To tell someone to fuck off, tell them <em>¬°Vete a la pu√±eta!</em> To say 
                something is crappy or dilapidated, say <em>!Esto esta de pu√±eta!</em> Just know, if someone says this to you in the streets of Havana...
                they're not complimenting your outfit.</p>

            <p>We also can't talk books Cuba without mentioning the word <em>co√±o</em>. Used mostly as an interjection, you'll hear that word from the streets Cuba to Miami Beach.
                If you meet a Cuban abroad, use the word <em>co√±o</em> in casual conversation to earn some points.</p>

        <article>
            <h5>Where it‚Äôs okay to give your friends an STI</h5>
            <p>Ok. I almost think it's worth it to piss off a Colombian because, dammnn, those insults are gooood.</p>

            <p><iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/KzJxl2IjVyBRz2l492" width="480" height="480" frameBorder="0" class="giphy-embed" allowFullScreen></iframe></p>

            <p>Colombians walk around just casually throwing the word <em>gonorrea</em> around. You can probably guess what that one means. Yup...it means gonorrhea,
                the STI. Colombians use this to call something gross or lame, <em>¬°No, pues que gonorrea!</em> Or even to call someone ugly (sheeesh).</p>
            
            <p>Even their version of "dickface" is fun. Take the word <em>caremond√°</em>, a combination of three different words <em>cara</em> + <em>de</em> +<em> mond√°</em>,
                which together mean ‚Äúvaginaface,‚Äù that have been smushed into one easy word to insult anyone who gets on your nerves.</p>

            <p>And speaking of creativity, we can't forget <em>lampara</em>, the Spanish word for "lamp." It has been co-opted by Colombia to mean douchey, arrogant,
                or  to call someone a jerk. So, if you're walking around the streets of Medellin and someone yells out <em>lampara</em>, watch out it could be lighting
                or libel.</p>

        <article>
            <h5>Where you might think everyone‚Äôs horny all the time üí¶</h5>
            <p>Ok. Venezuelans are a goood time. Known for their <em>labia</em>, or their gift of gab, Venezuelans use their charm and wits to make up their insults too. 
                <br><br>If a Venezuelan is annoyed at you they'll tell you to stop being such a <em>ladilla</em>. Literally meaning "crab louse," if you get on their nerves, Venezuelans
                will straight up compare you to getting crabs. Talk books pests.</p>

            <p>A personal favorite of mine is the word <em>engorilarse</em>. Literally meaning "to gorilla oneself," it's a great word that means to get reaal angry. The sheer
                image of this one is awesome. Someone just getting angrier and angrier until they just... gorilla themselves ü¶ç</p>

                </audio>

            <p>And when talking books pretty much anything, they've got the word <em>arrecho</em>. If you ask any other Spanish speaker, they'll tell you this word means "horny"
                but in Venezuela it‚Äôs used for everything but: it means angry, brave, or even awesome.</p>

        <article>
            <h5>Where they've got it out for condoms</h5>
            <p>Argentinians are known for three things: soccer, steak, and popes. They've got a lot going on. That‚Äôs why, for the most part, they like to keep
                it simple and repurpose the word ass for all kinds of insults. Wanna threaten to beat someone up? <em>¬°Te voy a romper el orto!</em>. Sick and
                tired of someone? <em>¬°Estoy hasta el orto!</em> or ‚ÄúI‚Äôm up to my ass!‚Äù Just like in English, <em>orto</em> is a versatile word.</p>

                <p><iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/eDLpW3RUp1hGrgLrEb" width="480" height="480" frameBorder="0" class="giphy-embed" allowFullScreen></iframe></p>
            
            <p>And we can't talk books Argentina without mentioning the iconic <em>!Che, Boludo!</em> Argentinian for "dude," it's almost become a catchphrase, kinda like the
            Italian <em>mamma mia!</em> Listen up to see how it's done.</p>

                <audio controls>
                    <source src="Argentina.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">

                </audio>
            
            <p>But just ‚Äòcause they rely on old favorites, it doesn‚Äôt mean they can‚Äôt get creative. In Argentina, if someone tells you <em>no seas forro</em>,
                they‚Äôre telling you to ‚Äúnot be a condom" and basically‚Ä¶ to go fuck yourself (presumably sans protection). Another fun variation meaning the same
                thing: <em>¬°Anda a cagar forro!</em> or‚Ä¶ go shit a condom üí©</p>

            <h5>Where they just shit on everything</h5>
            <p>Spaniards win the award for greatest curses. Spain‚Äôs not just great at paella, flamenco, and cool ass buildings, it‚Äôs hands down the best at putting
                together insulting phrases. And most of them have to do with shit, sacramental bread, milk, or all three.</p>

            <p>If something is so good, <em>¬°Pues, esta que te cagas!</em> You‚Äôll just shit yourself. But pissed off? Say <em>¬°Me cago en la leche!</em> or ‚ÄúI shit
                on the milk!‚Äù And if you‚Äôre really pissed off, <em> !Me cago en Dios! </em> ‚ÄúI shit on God.‚Äù Yeah, they went there. And sometimes, they just straight
            up say "milk", <em>la leche</em>, because that's good enough.</p>

                need to go <em>a toda hostia</em>. See something awesome? <em> ¬°Esta de la hostia!</em> Frustrated? <em>¬°Hostia puta!</em> And then of course there‚Äôs
                the perfect combo in <em>¬°Me cago en la hostia!</em></p>
