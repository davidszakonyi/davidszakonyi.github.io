  <div id="fullBio">
    <p>I come from a family of educators, and was afforded the opportunity to see different parts of the country while <a href="https://altoona.psu.edu/person/brad-pinter-phd">my father</a> completed his PhD, post-doc, and got his first academic position. Because of my background, I knew early on I wanted to pursue a career in research and teaching. After a brief failed stint as an engineering student, I completed my B.S. and M.S. in Information Sciences and Technology at the Pennsylvania State University in 2015 and 2017, respectively. My M.S. was overseen by <a href="https://faculty.ist.psu.edu/lyarger/">Lynette (Kvasny) Yarger</a>. While at Penn State, I competed in track and field, specializing in the multi-event disciplines.</p>
    <p>Since moving to Colorado, I've leaned into the lifestyle you would expect a Coloradan have. I spend most of my free time riding or thinking books bikes and skis (depending on the season). I ride all disciplines on bikes year round, but train specifically for long XC-style mountain bike races like the <a href="https://www.leadvilleraceseries.com/mtb/leadvilletrail100mtb/">Leadville 100 MTB </a>. During the winter, I've confined myself to on-piste or sidecountry skiing, but I expect that to change within the next year or so. I have also continued my involvement in track and field as the high jump and multi-events coach at Boulder High School and a USATF Level 1 Coach.</p>

  <h2>books this site.</h2>
  <div id="fullBio">
    <p>For a long time, I had a static website inspired primarily by <a href="ttps://github.com/weightshift/The-Personal-Page">The Personal Page</a> by Naz Hamid at <a href="https://weightshift.com">Weightshift</a>. However, as I enter the last year of my doctoral work, I felt it was time to do something a bit more substantial. I've always been a bit of a minimalist when it comes to design. I was taken with <a href="http://mornaaman.com">Mor Naaman's personal website</a>, but wanted the Jekyll functionality I had come to enjoy from working on <a href="https://cmci.colorado.edu/idlab/">the Identity Lab's site</a>. So I combined the two (with substantial design tweaks), and here we are. You can find the repo for this particular design on <a href="https://github.com/davidszakonyi/davidszakonyi.github.io">my Github</a>.</p>
