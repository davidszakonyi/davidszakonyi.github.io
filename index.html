    <h2>academic research</h2>
    <div id="shortBio">
      <p>I am an associate professor of political science and international affairs at <a href="https://politicalscience.columbian.gwu.edu/">George Washington University</a>. My research focuses on corruption, illicit financial flows, autocracy and non-market strategy, with current projects underway on Russia, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Germany, the United Kingdom and the United States. This work has been published in numerous journals, including the <em>American Political Science Review</em>, <em>American Journal of Political Science</em>, <em>Journal of Politics</em>, and <em>American Economic Review</em>. </p>
           
           <p> I am the author of three <a href="/#books">books</a>, most recently <a href="https://global.oup.com/academic/product/workplace-politics-9780197802007?cc=us&lang=en&">Workplace Politics: How Politicians and Employers Subvert Elections</a> (Oxford University Press, 2025) co-authored with <a href="https://www.timothyfrye.com/" class="special-link">Timothy Frye</a> and <a href="https://ojreuter.com/" class="special-link">Ora John Reuter</a>. Our book offers the first cross-national investigation of how, where, and why employees are mobilized politically at their workplaces around the world. 
            <p>I am currently finishing a book entitled <i>The Technocrats: Competent Loyalists and Authoritarian Rule</i>, which looks at the growing trend of technocrats working for dictators, with a special focus on Putin-era Russia.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">The Technocrats: Competent Loyalists and Authoritarian Rule</h2>
      <p>This book uncovers and explains a global trend among modern autocracies: they are getting smarter. As of 2020, one in four cabinet ministers across all authoritarian regimes had both studied at a Western university and finished a graduate degree, a nearly threefold increase over the past fifty years. This trend stands in sharp contrast not only to the popular image of dictators flanked by sycophantic cronies, but also to canonical work which has long held that autocrats favor loyalty over competence. Far from fearing expertise, I argue that modern dictators surround themselves with it, increasingly relying on elite, Western-educated technocrats to help them maintain legitimacy and social stability in a world of rising citizen expectations. The most striking case is Putin-era Russia, where technocrats trained at Western institutions and multinational firms have helped rescue the regime from the shocks of crushing sanctions and a disastrous war. 
</br> </br>This reliance, however, comes with risk: the most capable individuals are not only wary of joining corrupt and violent regimes, but they disrupt elite coalitions and pose new threats from within the state. How do authoritarian regimes recruit and entrust technocrats with meaningful authority without jeopardizing regime stability? To investigate this puzzle, I combine an in-depth study of Russia—drawing on brand-new data on over 1,500 top officials under Putin, surveys and elite interviews—with analysis of cross-national data on 103 authoritarian regimes and comparative case studies. The book shows how dictators have developed sophisticated strategies to reward, monitor, and ensure the continued loyalty of the technocrats they require. When given power, technocrats then strengthen and prolong authoritarian rule by helping stabilize economies and modernize the state and its coercive apparatus. By shifting the lens to the individuals who choose to work for dictatorships, I offer a new framework for understanding authoritarian resilience in the 21st century.

      </br> </br>In many countries politicians rely on employers to influence the voting behavior of their employees, but this type of voter mobilization has received very little attention. Workplace Politics draws on unique surveys of firm managers and employees in eight countries, as well as a wealth of fine-grained observational data and qualitative interviews from Russia, to demonstrate that workplace mobilization is common, often coercive, and unpopular with many voters. It argues that when firm managers depend on the state, cannot easily move their assets, or can easily replace workers, politicians can induce employers to get their workers to the polls.

In these settings, politicians and employers can use workplace mobilization to diminish voter autonomy, undermine electoral integrity, and skew electoral outcomes in favor of entrenched political groups. But because workplace mobilization is unpopular in the broader electorate, politicians use this strategy less frequently in information-rich settings, where voters are likely to learn about it. This book helps explain why countries whose economies are dominated by state interventions in markets, immobile capital, and slack labor markets may be especially prone to clientelism and autocratic rule and contributes to core debates in comparative politics and political economy.

      </br> </br>Businesspeople run for and win elected office around the world, with roughly one-third of members of parliament and numerous heads of states coming directly from the private sector. Yet we know little about why these politicians choose to leave the private sector and what they actually do while in government. In Politics for Profit, I bring to bear sweeping quantitative and qualitative evidence from Putin-era Russia to shed light on why businesspeople contest elections and what the consequences are for their firms and for society when they win. The book develops an original theory of businessperson candidacy as a type of corporate political activity undertaken in response to both economic competition and weak political parties. My evidence then shows that businesspeople help their firms reap huge gains in revenue and profitability while prioritizing investments in public infrastructure over human capital. The book finally evaluates policies for combatting political corruption.

      </br> </br>

Located in the northeastern corner of the Black Sea, Abkhazia was once part of Georgia but broke away from the country after the fall of the Soviet Republic. For fifteen years the region functioned as a de facto independent, though internationally unrecognized, state, until August of 2008, when the short war over South Ossetia (another breakaway territory) ended in Russia's recognition of Abkhazian and South Ossetian sovereignty.

Consequently, Abkhazia has become a crucial component of Russia's struggle to redefine its global influence and a major player in its geopolitical battle with the West. Under Siege clarifies Abkhazia's ethno-political dynamics, which have played a major role in the country's state-building efforts and have come to shape the conditions under which the country's many ethnic communities live. Abkhazians, Armenians, Georgians, and Russians all call Abkhazia home, and this volume explores the effect of the government's de facto status on these groups' ideas of nationhood and continuing tensions between Georgia, Abkhazia, and Russia. This book also launches a rare investigation into the conflict brewing among human rights, minority protections, and Abkhazia's state building project.
