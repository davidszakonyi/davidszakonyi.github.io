   title    : "The End of Londongrad? The Impact of Beneficial Ownership Transparency on Offshore Investment in UK Property"
   year     : 2025
   venue    : February
   link     : 12 Collin, Hollenbach, and Szakonyi - Working Paper.pdf
   abstract : "UK property markets are thought to be a common destination for corrupt and criminal assets, who often invest through offshore shell companies. Following the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022, we study the impact of the introduction of a policy in the UK intended to eliminate the anonymous ownership of property by requiring offshore companies to file their beneficial owners on public register. We find that new purchases by companies based in tax havens fell substantially following government announcements that the policy would be introduced that year, and further declines following the establishment of a register of ownership. While the policy has effectively led the offshore market to slow, between £45–78 billion worth of UK real estate is still owned by companies based in tax havens, some of which have yet to comply with their reporting obligations. We do not find strong evidence of price effects nor substitution into ownership through suspicious domestic companies, although larger movements may manifest as firms respond finalization of the policy in January 2023."

   title    : "Investing in Politics: Private Equity and Coordinated Political Activity"
   year     : 2025
   venue    : September
   link     : HollenbachSzakonyi_InvestingPolitics_2025.pdf
   abstract : "Despite the private equity industry’s rapidly growing presence in the U.S. economy, we know far more about its influence on corporate governance than its role in shaping public policy. In this paper, we document how private equity's distinctive ownership structure facilitates coordinated political activity among its portfolio companies, revealing a covert channel of influence over policymaking. First, we assemble a novel dataset of U.S. leveraged buyouts from 2000-2018 and match them to federal lobbying records. Applying a doubly robust difference-in-differences estimator, we show that portfolio companies acquired by private equity subsequently increase their federal lobbying. Then using an issue-level dataset, we find that after a buyout, portfolio companies are five times more likely to lobby on the very issues their PE acquirers had themselves lobbied on before. These findings demonstrate that private equity’s success owes not just to financial and operational engineering, but also to a deliberate coordination and optimization of political influence across portfolios."

   title    : "Educating the Opposition: Elite Universities in Authoritarian Russia"
   year     : 2025
   venue    : August
   abstract : "Does higher education undermine authoritarian stability? While classic modernization theory posits that education fosters democratization, recent scholarship suggests autocrats can strategically use higher education to achieve ideological control and prolong their rule. We reconcile these perspectives by theorizing that elite and non-elite universities in autocracies produce divergent political outcomes. To test this, we exploit Russia's prestigious Olimpiada competition in Russia, which grants top competitors across 21 subjects automatic admission into the Russian university of their choice. Using a brand new dataset of over 22,000 students combined with a novel behavioral measure of support for Alexey Navalny's Anti-Corruption Foundation, we show that Olimpiada's top performers are significantly more likely to support the opposition than their counterparts. Our findings reveal a paradox: while autocrats invest in higher education to drive economic growth, elite institutions may incubate dissent."

   title    : "The Impact of Beneficial Ownership Transparency on Illicit Purchases of US Property"
   year     : 2022
   venue    : January
   link     : 11 Collin, Hollenbach, and Szakonyi - Working Paper.pdf
   abstract : "High value real estate is a popular destination for corrupt and criminal foreign assets, in part caused by limited oversight and lack of transparency in real estate transactions. In response to these concerns, the US Treasury began implementing a series of Geographic Targeting Orders (GTOs) in 2016, forcing corporate buyers making all-cash purchases in targeted counties to report the company’s ultimate owner. To estimate the causal effect of GTOs on these types of transactions, we combine data on on millions of real estate transactions over the period 2014-2019 with a staggered difference-in-differences design. Our analysis suggests the absence of an aggregate effect of the GTOs on corporate all-cash purchases in targeted counties, as well as little evidence of substitution into other types of purchases. We contend that the lack of overt enforcement and validation of the ownership requirements failed to create a sufficient deterrent effect to drive out participation in the sector by illicit actors."

   title    : "Partisan Animosity and Support for Undemocratic Behavior: The Case of Russia"
   year     : 2023
   venue    : October
   link     : Polarization_102423.pdf
   abstract : "When can autocrats subvert democracy without paying electoral costs? Although ideological and partisan attachments are weak in many contemporary autocracies, regime supporters often have a strong emotional aversion toward the opposition, who the regime portrays as traitors. Drawing on the literature on affective polarization, we investigate whether regime supporters who hold such attitudes are less likely to punish regime candidates who behave undemocratically using a vignette survey experiment conducted in Russia. We find little evidence that regime supporters are more likely to excuse most types of undemocratic actions by their copartisan candidates. However, those supporters who express antipathy toward the regime’s staunchest opposition—Alexei Navalny and his supporters—are more likely to condone anti-democratic actions that specifically sideline Navalny’s movement. Negative affect toward the opposition may thus help explain how autocrats survive the periodic rise of challengers; yet it does not guarantee that they will avoid backlash for undemocratic actions."

   title    : "Corruption and Property Rights in Russia: Evidence from the Commercial Court System"
   year     : 2022
   venue    : September
   abstract : "Corruption is often rampant within state bureaucracies and judicial systems, yet we know little about its micro-level consequences on policymaking and the provision of public goods. In this paper, we investigate how corruption shapes property rights protection in one prominent autocracy: Russia. First, we use income and asset disclosures to construct novel individual-level measures of corruption for 366 commercial court judges working in and around Moscow. Then, drawing on data from more than 400,000 court cases heard between 2011-2018, we leverage random assignment of cases to judges to show that corrupt judges are much more likely to find in favor of private firms in their disputes with government agencies. Not only are these decisions of lower judicial quality, but they tend to favor disreputable firms. In contrast to existing studies' emphasis on political pressure's impact on Russian court cases, we show that judicial corruption enables firms to capture the state, depriving it of financial resources and undermining the rule of law."
