      <p>Using Generative AI, I generated the text and photos for a series of Valentine's Day cards. I prompted ChatGPT3 for "Hallmark style Valentine's Day card slogans" and used those as inspiration to prompt MidJourney for the card art. Photos by Hunter Allen-bonney.</p>

    <h3>Process</h3>

    <p>The process of putting these cards together involved four steps.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Querying for front-of-card text using ChatGPT.</li>
      <li>Using those outputs as fodder to prompt MidJourney for images.</li>
      <li>Returning to ChatGPT to generate inside-of-card text.</li>
      <li>Laying the text and images out in a card format.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Throughout the day on Valentine's Day 2023, I'll be updating this process documentation</p>

    
    <h4>Part 1: Querying ChatGPT3 for card ideas (front-of-card text)</h4>

    <p>I started with ChatGPT3, prompting <em>Write me the text for a valentine's day card</em>.</p>

    <p>ChatGPT3 replied with: <em>"Happy Valentine's Day my love! My heart beats for you every single day and I feel so incredibly lucky to have you in my life. You are my everything.</em></p>

    <p>I was looking for less of a message to give to my partner, and more of something to put on the front of the card. To try to guide the AI towards something more like what I was looking for, I next prompted it for <em>I'm making a Hallmark style Valentine's Day card; can you give me some options for what the front should say?</em></p>

    <p>ChatGPT3 (helpfully) gave me a list</p>
    <ol>
      <li>"Forever and always, my heart belongs to you."</li>
      <li>"You stole my heart, but I'll let you keep it."</li>
      <li>"My love for you grows stronger with every passing day."</li>
      <li>"You are my everything, my Valentine."</li>
      <li>"With you, every day feels like Valentine's Day."</li>
      <li>"I'm the luckiest to have you as my Valentine."</li>
      <li>"Forever by your side, my love."</li>
      <li>"My heart beats for you, my Valentine."</li>
      <li>"I love you more than words can say."</li>
      <li>"You make my heart skip a beat."</li>
    </ol>

    <p>These remained somewhat serious in nature, but were closer to what I was looking for. But they struck me as the type of sayings that might be on the inside of the card, where I was looking for sayings for the outside of the card. My final prompt was <em>Generate some funny sayings for the front of a Valentine's Day card.</em></p>

    <ol>
      <li><strong>"I'm nuts books you."</strong></li>
      <li><strong>"You're the apple of my eye."</strong></li>
      <li><strong>"You make my heart race like a cheetah on a treadmill."</strong></li>
      <li>"I'm lucky in love, but I'm even luckier to have you."</li>
      <li>"You're the bacon to my breakfast."</li>
      <li>"You're my everything, except for that one thing you did last week."</li>
      <li><strong>"I love you more than unicorns love rainbows."</strong></li>
      <li>"You're the one I want to spend my life with, but let's start with Valentin's Day."</li>
      <li>"I'm your biggest fan, except when it comes to your love for cilantro."</li>
      <li><strong>"I never knew love could be this cheesy, until I met you."</strong></li>
    </ol>

    <p>Bingo! This is what I was looking for. I bolded the outputs that I ended up using for the cards.</p>

    
    <h4>Part 2: Prompting MidJourney for images</h4>

      <p>A good card has compelling imagery. To generate that imagery for the five prompts bolded above, I used MidJourney.</p>

      <p>Perhaps obviously, just plugging in the card text from ChatGPT3 may not work. Instead, I took the card text and imagined what a punny or cheesy card might pair with that text. The prompt that started with was #3 -- <em>You make my heart race like a cheetah on a treadmill.</em> I prompted
